 https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/learn/lecture/16581564#overview - This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory app. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation. We will dive deep into Node, Express and MongoDB.
